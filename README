Vallst is a solver for problems with boolean variables. You can use it either
through its reentrant API, vallstAPI.h, or its standalone variant, vallst.

Vallst is distributed under the terms of the Reciprocal Public License RPL.
See the file LICENSE.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.
OSI Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.

To install vallst, see the file INSTALL.

Known problems: Linux stack overflow
The startup phase when running the solver involves the use of a recursive
function. If the stack size is small, which it is by default for some reason
on Linux systems (10MB), the solver might run out of stack memory and segfault
on very large problems. Hence you might want to increase the stack size a bit.
Under Linux you can run ulimit. "ulimit -s 30000" will set the size to about
30MB. "ulimit -a" lists the size.

If you generated documentation using doxygen during the installation, that
documentation can be found at docs/html/index.html and at
docs/latex/refman.[dvi|pdf|ps] if you used latex. (Documentation will be
generated if you follow the default installation procedure (by "make") or by
running e.g. "make -k doc".)

The intentions are to maintain vallst to be as fast and robust as possible, 
improving it by implementing any new good idea, and to include into the API
any useful functionality.

Comments, suggestions, bug reports etc. are welcome.
